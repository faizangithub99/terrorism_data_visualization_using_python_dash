# terrorism_data_visualization_using_dashframework
The project is about terrorism analysis with insight and which has some requirements like it should be able to run the Python file from the command line and it should open itself in a web browser and after completion of work it should close also from browser, second one is it should also directly close the script running in the background. A Comprehensive and highly dynamic analytical User Interface Application is developed using a powerful UI library and framework named Dash in Python, that aims at providing detailed insights on worldwide terrorist attacks from the year 1970 to 2018. Dash framework allows a developer to build high level UI applications that contain extensively integrated user components to gain the benefits of maximum dynamicity from the application in the least possible time. Moreover, it is best and easy to use library to make good visualizations via time series plots (e.g., stacked area graph) and maps and helps in inclusion of effective UI components as it uses html, javascript and css internally. You can also create your own custom components using Javascript and React Js, so building a fast and robust UI application is a lot more easier with this framework.
